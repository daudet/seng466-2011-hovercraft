			<h1 class="title">Project Objectives</h1>

			<p>In this initial project the main goal for our team is to become
			familiar with the hardware and software environment that will be
			required for further project work down the road. We will be using a gamepad,
			sonar, dc motors, wireless radios and Arduino boards to create
			a basic control system that will be modified and improved upon for
			our final project.</p>

			<h1 class="title">Problem Description</h1>

			<p>Project 1 involves making a rotating platform that will be able to sense and face walls or other obstacles that are placed in front of it. The platform should be able to be controlled by a USB PS2 controller as well as autonomously through the use of sensors and control logic. A remote base station will be constructed using an Arduino UNO board which will send wireless commands to another Arduino UNO board located on the platform. An Arduino Mega clone will also be onboard the platform and will be used to control the sensors and actuators responsible for platform movement.</p>

			<p>An overview of our system is shown below</p>
